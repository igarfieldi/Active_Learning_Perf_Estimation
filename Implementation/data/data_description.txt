*** DATA DESCRIPTION ***

Each of the dataset files contains the following variables:
  X ....... (N x D) Feature Matrix with rows corresponding to the N instances and columns to the D features
  Y ....... (N x 1) Class Label Vector (the classification target)
  Tx ...... (N x 1) Time Vector of feature information (i.e. at which time featurevector of each instance becomes known)
  Ty ...... (N x 1) Time Vector of label information (i.e. at which time class label becomes known)
  
Groups 1--3: Please ignore Tx and Ty
Groups 4-5: Please use Tx for reference.

Use 
  load ['../data/' Filename] to load them into the workspace
or 
  data=load(['../data/' Filename]);
to load them into a structure named data (where you can access the fields data.X, data.Y and so on)

Use 
  who
or 
  fieldnames(data)
to identify the variables therein.

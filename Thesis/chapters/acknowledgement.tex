\label{acknowledgement}

First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Daniel Kottke and Dr. Georg Krempl, for their continuous support and expenditure of time throughout the process of writing this thesis, without which I could not have finished it.

I would also like to thank both Dennis Kammerhoff and Sven Kalle for enduring my complaints and their moral support.

Another "thank you" goes to my family, especially my sister Alexandra, also for their help and support.

Last but not least, I want to thank the staff of the assay office for dispelling my questions and uncertainties of just about every aspect of my studies.
